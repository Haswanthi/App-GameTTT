# App-GameTTT
I developed a mobile application using Kotlin and Java, leveraging XML for the design implementation of the game page, login, and signup screens. The app utilizes Firebase database functionality for user authentication and registration. The main feature of the app is a Tic Tac Toe game, allowing two players to engage in matches.
